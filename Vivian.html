     <p>Hi, my name is Julia, and this is my story. I am a lonely girl with no friends. <br>
     When it's time for school, I concentrate on getting good grades. My goal is to be the <br>
      first in my class.</p>

      <img ="Screenshot 2025-10-17 155220.png">>

<p>One day my mom said, “You're going to high school.” I was happy and sad at the same time.<br>
 My mom said, "You will make new friends." I was scared because I didn't know anyone. <br>
I became nervous but Dad told me to be strong.<br>
On the first day, I was isolated <br>
On the second day, I got some friends <br>
On the third day, I was known by my classmates  and that was an advantage for me.</p>
        <p> 
         One day, I came to school and I found rubbish in my locker.I got very scared.<br> 
        I told my teacher about the incident. I told them that I was being bullied.</p>
        <p>
        
 The bullies planned to throw me down the stairs but I was lucky. First, they put water<br>
  in the hallway where I was walking but a cute boy caught me before I could reach the ground.<br>
   He stared  into  my eyes for some time. By the way, his name is Jude and he is the most <br>
   popular boy in school. All the girls ran crazy for him.<br>
        </p>
     
        <p>Back to the point, I fell into Jude’s hands. I said sorry immediately. But Mary and<br>
             Lisa were very angry with me. They were angry because Jude had helped me out, so <br>
             they continuously shouted at me, I was shocked and opened my eyes wide. I do not <br>
             understand what was happening.
        </p>
        PICTURE
        <p>I just ignored them and continued with my life. One day I was moving to the lockers<br> 
            to put my books I found Jude standing there so we chatted for some good time. I<br>
             discovered that he is not a bad person so I got to know him better and he got to <br>
             know me better, and one thing in common and that is our names start with J. Jude<br>
              and I became friends, as usual, Lisa and Mary were jealous.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I finished preparing myself, we were called to the starting line, we started the<br>
race. I was one of the first participants and the first girl but as I was running, the other<br> 
participants tried to overtake me and I really wanted to give up, I started slowing down but when<br> I 
had the DJ play a certain song, I was motivated and encouraged to keep on running. move on.<br>
</p
<p>
     After I was done freshening up, dressed up and went to the main hall for the judges to<br>
     announce the winners.   I was so happy to find out that I was the winner, I screamed and <br>
     jumped into the air with happiness. Jude and the rest of the school congratulated me for <br>
     getting a golden medal, Jude got a silver medal.<br><p>

     Our lives moved on, we started studying all the time but a new announcement popped up,<br>
      “  TEENS DAY OUT", that meant no teachers allowed, but I was not that interested but<br> 
      I was forced to come. Lisa and Mary never wanted me to attend the party so they sneaked <br>
      into my room and cut my dress. I cried for some time. My best friend cheered me up and<br>
       told me “Crying will not solve the problem,”. I never gave up on my dress. I decided to <br>
       make it look pretty by making  designs in the damaged areas. It looked prettier than<br>
       before. By the time I finished,  it was already time for the party so I got dressed as <br>
       soon as possible. I was the center of attention. The two girls were very jealous and<br> 
       angry, the party continued on and on. At the end of the party, everyone was so tired <br>
       that they slept there at the party but I was not that local to sleep at the party so I<br>
        moved to the hotel where my room was and I just fell on the bed without bathing.<br>
</p>

<p>
     Early in the morning, I woke up, went to the bath, and brushed my teeth. When I was <br>
     freshening up, I went to the kitchen to find something to eat because I was very hungry.<br>
     As I was going to the kitchen I realized that I had not cooked breakfast so I just ate an<br>
      apple with some soda. Then I heard the doorbell ring,  I remembered that I had visitors.<br>
      I was not ready because I did not have food to feed them, so I ran to my room and put on my<br>
       headsets. I pretended not to hear them. They thought i was sleeping,i wasted a lot of <br>
       time dressing up for class,missed the assembly,  I ran to class ,I found the music <br>
       teacher teaching, i sat down  in my seat <br>
</p>
       <p>
       I think I know why we love music lessons because the teacher is kind. We received a <br>
       new classmate called Luke , he is so cute that he attracted many girls but not me .<br> 
       They announced the prom  competition. Jude asked me to be his prom date. I said yes <br>
       with a big smile,I rushed to my room and then started  looking for what to put on. <br>
       As I was looking, I heard the door bell ring. I opened the door and found  a gift box<br> 
       it was sent by Jude ,I opened  it and found a dress, i tried it on.We won the title <br>
       best prom ever,that means King and Queen. We graduated from high school, 
       I became a doctor while Jude became a pilot. Jude and I got married and gave birth to <br>
       two children named Jade and Joseph.
The end.
