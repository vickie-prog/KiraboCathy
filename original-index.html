                       <u> <i>MY DAY</i></u> 
                                          <p> <b> <i>Today</i></b> has been a wonderful day although it started off on a bad knot. The night was amazing; 
    my bed was pretty warm and cozzy the lights were off. Everything felt right until my alarm
     rung at 6. I was so devasated about the situation. I was very angry; i wished the night had 
     just began. I stretched out of my hand and switched off the alarm clock. I figured i could sleep 
     for another 45 minutes. I closed my eyes and tried not to think about anything so i could sleep 
     but i couldn't. I did not go back to sleep. </p>
    <p>So i woke up, showered, brushed my teeth and  did my face rountine. After all that, 
    i had a very importnat decision to make. That was to get my outfit for the day. I am so 
    indecisive about what i want to wear for the day. I think to myself; will i look presentable?,
     will i look smart? and so i keep on changing outfits until i am satisfied with the outfit. 
     I finally chose an outfit for the day and i felt smart and comfortable in my outfit. So i left dorm 
     and headed for school.</p>

     <p>I reached the dining hole, and there was some amazing food. The eggs looked delicious but sadly i 
     could not eat them because of my health problems. I instead took cereal; my best cereal Cinnamon toast crunch.
     When i eat that cereal i feel so happy. So that morning I had cereal then I headed out for collection.
     Normal collection just like everytime, there were several anouncements.</p>

     My classes were amazing. I had humanitites and that was so interesting. We all talked about things that mattered to us.
     I brought my item and shared my story and so did everyone else. The stories I had were so touching
     and beautiful. This was a wonderful time to get to know my classmates. that was an amzing 
     activity. I really appreciate Roger for making us do it. 
     My other classes were nice. I did not have any trouble with any of them expect the fact 
     that i was tired. I started dozing off and could not pay attention in my last block.
     Later during the day, we had to play soccer. I had a wonderful time playing. Even though my 
     team did not achive our goal, we made sure to have fun. I had fun and enjoyed seeing everyone playing
     else playing. Seeing everyone work together was a wonderful experience. I would say that
     soccer was the best part of the day. It makes me smile.
